RandomClue.java (Tester) Analyses:
1) *After testing the program in with the random answer set, 
    it seemed to have a very lower change to get the correct 
    theory in fewer than 30 tries. 
    Most of the times the test shows up attempts from 200 t0 800.  
   *When testing the program with the answer set 6, 10, 6, 
    it seemed to be the best way to test because it gave me at 
    least one time in about 20 tests and the rest of the tests 
    showed attempts between 40 to 300. When testing with 
    answer set of 1, 1, 1, it seems to be close to the answer set 6,10, 6; 
    but in 50 tests, I did not get one less than 20 attempts. 
   *In order to get the correct theory, it seems to be better to 
    test from the maximum values as the random generator often 
    generates the greater values.

2) *This technique seems makes this programming easier to code, 
    however, it is a bad technique because is most hard coding

My Implementation (DetectiveJill.java and HW01Driver.java) 
will always finds the correct theory within 20 or less guesses.
1) *This technique also works better with the set of answer of 6, 10, 6, 
    which make me conclude that the Random class used to generate 
    values will most likely generate greatest values.
2) *This technique is better than the previews because of a special 
    class that represents detective Jill was added. 
   *This make this program to be more a modular program and 
make the code more understandable and easy to read.
